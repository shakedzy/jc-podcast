Do you wanna develop an app? Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack. It's like the N word and the C word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. Hit the sack, Jack!

If anything happened to you I would kill myself! I love you bad, bobo! Hey listen, you know, if we're all bored over here, wouldn't the common denominator be you? Your special time is your power. It makes you strong like a boob. Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick!

I'm sorry, Morty, it's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back. So now we're gonna have to go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty. Because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important. And they'll tear us apart, Morty. But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty. And you're gonna be part of them. And together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna- do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. 100 years, Rick and Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long forever. All a hundred days. 

Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or, family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card. Meeseeks were not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! You're not gonna believe this, because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake.
